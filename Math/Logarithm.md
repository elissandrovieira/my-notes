Logarithms are the opposite of [[power]].
Ex:
```
10°2 = 100 -> log10 100 = 2
10°3 = 1000 -> log10 1000 = 3
2°3 = 8 -> log2 8 = 3
2°4 = 16 -> log2 16 = 4
2°5 = 32 -> log2 32 = 5
```
The logarithm expression simply ask: How many n1 I need multiply to reach at  n2?
In log2 32, the expression ask: How many 2  I need multiply to reach at  32? And the answer is 5.
