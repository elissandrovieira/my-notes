## Git Overview

Git, an open-source distributed version control system, empowers users to efficiently and collaboratively manage source code and project files. It actively tracks changes to files, enabling easy switching between different versions, branch creation for experimentation, merging of changes, and seamless collaboration. Git facilitates both local and remote work, making it convenient for individual developers and teams alike. It offers numerous benefits, including version history, streamlined rollback, conflict resolution, and seamless integration with popular development platforms. Its flexibility, speed, and robustness have established Git as the de facto standard for version control in the software development industry.

Additionally, Git provides excellent support for branching, merging, and repository history rewriting, with the added advantage of the widely-used pull request feature that facilitates efficient code review and collaboration within teams. As the most widely adopted version control system globally, Git has solidified its position as the modern standard in software development.

## How Git works?

Here is a basic overview of how Git works:

1. Create a **repository** (project) with a Git hosting tool.

2. **Copy or clone** the repository to your local machine.

3. Add a file to your local repository and **commit** (save) the changes locally.

4. **Push** your changes to the remote repository.

5. **Pull** the file to local repository and make changes, and then **commit** and **push** the file.

6. Create a **branch** (alternative), make a change, commit the change.

7. Open a **pull request** (propose changes to the master branch).

8. **Merge** your branch to the master branch.
