A version control system (VCS), also known as a source control system or revision control system, is a software tool that helps developers manage changes to their source code and other files. It provides a structured approach to track, document, and control different versions of files, enabling collaboration, facilitating team workflows, and ensuring code integrity.

UiPath projects are typically developed using external version control systems to manage source code and track changes over time.

You can use any version control system that suits your requirements, such as Git, SVN (Subversion), or TFS (Team Foundation Server). UiPath projects are usually stored as collections of files, including workflow files (.xaml), configuration files, and other supporting files.

## Benefits of Version Control System

- **History and version tracking**
	Version control systems keep a complete history of all changes made to files, allowing developers to track and view the evolution of the codebase.
	
- Collaboration and teamwork
	Version control systems facilitate collaboration among team members working on the same project. Multiple developers can work on different branches, make changes, and merge them back into the main codebase.Â 
	
- **Branching and merging**
	Version control systems allow developers to create branches, which are independent lines of development. Branches enable the isolation of new features or experimental changes from the main codebase, providing a safe space for development without affecting the stability of the main branch. Branches can be merged back into the main branch once the changes are tested and approved.
	
- **Code integrity and backup**
	Version control systems maintain code integrity by documenting, reviewing, and validating changes before integration. They minimize the risk of errors and serve as backups by storing the project's complete history for easy reversion to previous versions.
	
- **Traceability and auditing**
	Version control systems provide traceability by associating each change with relevant information, such as the reason for the change, associated issues or tickets, and the person responsible. This traceability aids in auditing, compliance, and helps in understanding the context behind specific modifications.
	
- **Experimentation and rollbacks**
	With version control systems, developers can experiment with new ideas, features, or improvements without fear of damaging the existing codebase. If an experiment doesn't work out as expected, it's easy to roll back to a previous known good state and continue from there.
	
- **Code reviews and continuous integration**
	Version control systems seamlessly integrate with code review and continuous integration/delivery tools. They facilitate systematic code reviews, improving code quality and knowledge sharing. By setting up continuous integration workflows, code changes can be automatically built, tested, and deployed upon each commit, streamlining the development process.
