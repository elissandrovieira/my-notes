# Computer Generations
## First Generation - Tubes

- Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC):
	- Costed the equivalent of $16 million
	- Weighed 30 tons
	- Had tens of thousands of tubes
	- Processing power lower than that of a "bakery calculator"

## Second Generation - transistors

- IBM 7094
	- The first to come with a programming language
	- With system software (similar to an operating system)


## Third Generation - Integrated Circuits

- IBM System/360
	- Released in 1964
	- Allowed IBM to dominate 70% of the market
	- With it, the concept of a computer *family* emerged

## Later Generations

- In 1971, the first microprocessor in the world appeared: Intel 4004
- In 1975, the first microprocessor to be used in a personal computer appeared: 8080
