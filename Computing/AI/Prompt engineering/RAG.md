## Overview

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** in AI and NLP contexts.

**What is RAG?**

- It’s a technique that combines **retrieval** (searching for relevant documents or information from a large database) with **generation** (using a language model like GPT to generate responses).
    
- Instead of relying solely on the model’s internal knowledge, RAG first **retrieves** relevant external information and then **generates** an answer based on both the retrieved data and what it "knows."
    

**Why is it useful?**

- It helps language models give more **accurate**, **up-to-date**, or **specific** answers by grounding them in real data.
    
- Useful for tasks like question answering, summarization, or chatbots where you want the model to access a big knowledge base dynamically.
