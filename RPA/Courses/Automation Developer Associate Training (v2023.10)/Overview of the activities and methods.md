## ðŸ¤”What's File and Folder Automation?

File and Folder Automation involves automating tasks you do with your files and folders on your computer, like creating, copying, or renaming them. Studio offers a number of activities that help users automate tasks having to do with files and folders.Â 

Check out below what you can most commonly do with them:Â 

- **Copy**â€”copying a file or a folder from a specified location to another with the "Copy File" and "Copy Folder" activities.Â 

- **Create**â€”create an empty file in a specified location or a folder in a specified location with the "Create File" and "Create Folder" activities.

- **Delete**â€”delete a file or folder with the "Delete File" and "Delete Folder" activities.

- **Move**â€”the "Move File" and "Move Folder" activities allow you to move a file or a folder, giving you the option to overwrite duplicates.

- **Rename**â€”with the "Rename File" and "Rename Folder" actions, you can rename either a file or folder, while being able to choose between keeping the extension or not, in the case of a file.

- **Browse for..**.â€”the "Select File" action opens a dialog box during runtime which allows you to choose the file you want to work with. "Browse for Folders" works similarly, but of course for folders.

- **Check if an item exists**â€”"File Exists" and "Folder Exists" are two activities that check whether a file or folder exists. We need to provide the file or folder path and the result can be saved in a Boolean variable. Later on, this variable can be used in other activities: e.g. as a condition in an If activity - if the file exists, then skip the current file.

- **Iterate through**â€”"For Each File in Folder" iterates through all the files in a folder, while "For Each Folder in Folder" does that for all the folders in a folder.

- **Get info**â€”with the "Get File Info" and "Get Folder Info" actions, we can obtain the information about a file or a folder and store it in a variable of type "FileInfo".

- **Work with archives**â€”the "Compress/Zip Files"Â action enables us to add files or folders to a compressed file.Â The "Extract/Unzip Files"Â action helps extract all contents of a compressed file to a specified folder.

## ðŸ¤”How do I use the activities?

These are part of the 2022.10.4 System Activities Pack that contains all the basic activities used for creating automation projects. The activities from the File section enable the robot to directly interact with directories and files on your machine. You'll have to select those depending on the nature of the task you're automating.
