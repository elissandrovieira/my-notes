# üîçWhat is  data manipulation?
Is the process of modifying, structuring, formatting, or sorting data to make it easier to read, use and manage. 

Data manipulation helps transform raw data into an asset that can help optimize business operations and drive innovation. Some of the ways in which data manipulation can help achieve this are listed below:

- **Consistent data**
	 Data collected from various sources might not be well organized. Data manipulation can ensure that data is structured and stored consistently.

- **Data integration**
	 In many cases, data is stored in collected and stored in multiple locations. Data manipulation methods enable the integration of data from various sources providing a consolidated view of the data.

- **Data visualization**
	Data manipulation helps structure data in a format that supports effective visualization. Organizing and summarizing data helps create meaningful dashboards, charts, or reports that communicate insights clearly and concisely.¬†
   
- **Data analysis**
	 To conduct data analysis or modelling, data needs to be prepared in a suitable format. Data manipulation facilitates in transforming and organizing data to make it compatible with analysis technique.

# üß©Objects, Properties and Methods
To understand data manipulation, we need to know what objects, methods and properties are.

- **Objects**
	The fundamental building blocks of [[ Visual Basic]]; almost everything that you do in Visual Basic involves modifying objects. ¬†A variable holds an object. For example, if Username = "John Doe", then the Username variable holds the "John Doe" String object.

- **Properties**
	The attributes of an object or an aspect of its behavior. For example, the string class contains tow properties: **Chars**(returns de Char object a at specified position in the current String object) and Length(returns the number of characters in the current String object). Ex.:
	- `StrVar.Length`

- **Methods**
	The actions that an object can perform. Methods often have parameters that quelify how action is performed. Ex.:
	- `StrVar.Split("-")`
