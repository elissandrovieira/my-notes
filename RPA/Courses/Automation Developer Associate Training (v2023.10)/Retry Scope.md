The Retry Scope activity allows you to repeat the execution of enclosed activities as long as a specific condition isn't met or an error is encountered.

The purpose of the Retry Scope activity is to catch and handle errors, similar to the TryCatch activity. However, the key difference is that Retry Scope focuses on retrying the execution of activities rather than providing a more complex error handling mechanism. It simplifies the process by automatically retrying the activities until the condition is met or an error is thrown.
