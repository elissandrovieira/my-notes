## ü§îWhat is logging?

Logging can be defined as the process of recording events or actions that occur during the execution of a workflow. It involves creating log messages that contain details such as process start/end, timestamps, error messages, severity levels of messages, user inputs, or any other information relevant to an action and then storing them in a Log file.¬†

Effective logging practice is an essential part of developing automation as it helps understand the flow of execution of workflows and identify the cause of errors or unexpected behaviors.

## üåøTypes of logs in UiPath

Before we learn how to set up logs that are useful when developing projects, let's first start by checking out the main types of logs generated by the UiPath Platform:¬†

## ü§ñRobot logs

There are two types of Robot logs:

- **Robot execution logs:**¬†These are messages generated by the execution of a process and contain information related to its behavior and user-defined messages.¬†

- **Robot diagnostics log:**¬†These provide information related to the Robot itself and its context.¬†

Our focus will be on the robot execution logs as they can be used to supervise, diagnose, and debug processes in production, and gather process performance data.

Robot execution logs can either be¬†**default logs**¬†or¬†**user-defined logs**.

| ![[Pasted image 20250504162204.png]] | **Default logs**¬†are generated automatically when certain events take place. These events can be the start/end of a process or a transaction, encountering an error, or when the Robot Logging Setting is set to Verbose.<br><br>- **Execution start**¬†is generated every time a process is started (Level = Information).<br>- **Execution end**¬†is generated every time a process is finalized (Level = Information).<br>- **Transaction start**¬†is generated every time a transaction within a process is started (Level = Information).<br>- **Transaction end**¬†is generated every time a transaction within a process is finalized (Level = Information).<br>- **Error log**¬†is generated every time the execution encounters an error and stops (Level = Error).<br>- **Debugging log**¬†is generated if the Robot Logging Setting is set to Verbose, and contains, Activity names, types, variable values, arguments, etc. (Level = Trace).<br><br>**User-defined logs**¬†are generated according to the process designed by you in Studio when using Log Message Activity or Write Line Activity. |

## üéöÔ∏èLogging levels in UiPath

Each log has a Log Level that refers to how important the generated message is. In other words, logging levels let you sort log messages by severity, or by how important a log message is related to the execution of a process. Log levels are used in Orchestrator to filter out logs below a specific level.

Given below is a list of log levels in descending order of their priority along with their meaning.

| **Logging Level**           | **Meaning**                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Fatal/ Critical**         | The robot cannot or shouldn't recover from this error. Something has gone critically wrong, and the process needs to stop.                                                               |
| **Error**                   | An error has occurred. The robot will try to recover and move on with the next item.                                                                                                     |
| **Warning**                 | Any important data that you need to stand out from the rest of the log information.                                                                                                      |
| **Information**             | Information about robot progress. Usually includes when you enter/exit a workflow, when data is read from an external source, etc.                                                       |
| **Trace**                   | Information that's useful while developing/debugging, however not useful and needed in production.                                                                                       |
| **Debugging/Verbose level** | Verbose level generates default logs for the execution of each Activity, allowing a much more in-depth diagnosis by giving more information about the values of variables and arguments. |
