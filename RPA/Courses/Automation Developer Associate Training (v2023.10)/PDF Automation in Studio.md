**Portable Document Format** or **PDF** is a widely used file format for storing and sharing documents. PDFs are typically meant to be read-only documents that preserve their format and appearance regardless of the device being used. They are also designed to be platform-independent meaning they do not require a specific software, hardware or operating system to be viewed. 

In this course, we'll explore activities that are available in UiPath Studio that help automate extracting data from PDFs.
