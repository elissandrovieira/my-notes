Orchestrator manages the resources to be used in automation projects and consumed by robots, and access to them through support for hierarchical structuring combined with fine-grained role assignment. It acts as an integration point with third-party solutions and applications.Â 

In this course, you'll look at topics such as working with queues, differentiating processes based on the way they handle transactions, as well as clearly identifying transactions to automate within a process. Apart from this, you'll also look at the possibility of using Orchestrator as a repository for libraries, assets, and so on.
