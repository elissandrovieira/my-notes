# 🗺️ Overview

So far, you have learned how to perform string manipulation using string methods and regular expressions. Apart from these techniques, there are string activities available in Studio that can also perform string manipulation.

In the below video, we'll cover the following string activities:

- **Text to Left/Right**
- **Modify Text**
- **Change Type**

| Activity           | Objective                                                                                       | Example                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Text to Left/Right | Retrieve text form L/R with an indicated separator                                              | ![[Pasted image 20250502160054.png]] |
| Modify Text        | Use the methods:<br>- Find and Replace<br>- Combine text<br>- Trim<br>- Text to Upper/Lowercase | ![[Pasted image 20250502160432.png]] |
| Change Type        | Change the string type to another                                                               | ![[Pasted image 20250502160624.png]] |

# 📌Text and date handling activities

The new string activities for data manipulation simplify processes that previously required complex activities or .NET methods. 

 *Click on each section below to discover the new activities for string manipulation and how they can enhance your workflows.

## 📝Text handling activities

1. **Split Text**—split a string of text based on a default separator (new line, space, tab, comma, colon, semicolon). 
2. **Combine Text**—combine two strings of text based on a default separator (new line, space, tab, comma, colon, semicolon) or one or more custom characters.
3. **Extract Text**—extract specific text from an input based on specific filters. 
4. **Change Case**—change the case of text. 
5. **Find and Replace**—find a given text and replace all its occurrences with another given text. 

## 📅Date handling activities

1. **Extract Date and Time from Text**—extracts date and time from the given input text matching the specified format and outputs the first result as a DateTime variable if only the first result is needed or a collection of DateTime variables if more results are found. 
2. **Add or Subtract from Date**—modify a DateTime input by adding or subtracting a specific unit of time. The output is saved in a DateTime variable. 
3. **Format Date as Text**—used to transform a DateTime variable into a string output based on the chosen format and localization.
