## 🗺️Overview

Dictionary variables (`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`) are collection type of variables of (key, value) pairs, in which the keys are unique. Think of the Address Book in your mobile phone, where each entry has corresponding data (name, phone number(s), email address, etc).

The data types for both keys and values have to be chosen when the variable is declared. Data types within dictionaries can be any of the supported variables (String, Int32, etc) including `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`.

The operations that are most often associated with dictionaries are:

- Adding and deleting (key, value) pairs.
- Retrieving the value associated with a key.
- Re-assigning new values to existing keys.

## 🔍Methods for working with dictionary variables 

- **Initialization**
	As in the case of list variables, dictionary variables need to be initialized as well. For example, if we want to initialize a dictionary of **String type of key** and **String type of value**, we can add **new Dictionary(Of String, String)** inside the **Default** value field in the **Variables** panel or **Data Manager** panel for the respective variable, or use an **Assign** activity to assign the value to the variable within the workflow.

- **Adding Key-Value Pairs**
	`VarName.Add(Key, Value)` adds an item to an existing dictionary variable. Because `Add` doesn't return a value, we use the **Invoke Method** or **Assign** activity.

- **Removing Keys**
	`VarName.Remove(Key)` removes an item from the dictionary variable. It can be used in an **Invoke Method** activity. 

- **Retrieving**
	- `VarName.Item(Key)` returns the Dictionary item by its key.
	- `VarName.Count` returns an Int32 value of the number of Dictionary items.
	- `VarName.ContainsKey(Key)` checks if the item with the given key exists in the dictionary variable and returns a **Boolean** result.
