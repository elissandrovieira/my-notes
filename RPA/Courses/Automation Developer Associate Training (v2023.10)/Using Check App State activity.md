## üó∫Ô∏èOverview

The Check App State activity in UiPath verifies the state of an application or web browser by monitoring the appearance or disappearance of a specific element. It allows for executing different sets of activities based on whether the element is found or not.

This activity extends beyond checking a single UI element and can observe the entire application for changes.¬†

We can also use this as a condition within the Retry Scope activity, enabling retries based on the application's state.

Additionally, the Check App State activity can be used independently of the Use Application/Browser activity. This provides the flexibility to monitor and control the application or web browser state throughout your automation process.

By leveraging the Check App State activity, you can create dynamic and robust automation workflows that adapt to the evolving states of applications and browsers, and enhancing the reliability and effectiveness .
