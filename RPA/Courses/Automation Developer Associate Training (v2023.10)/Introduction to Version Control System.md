## 🤔What factors should you consider when selecting a version control system?

Irrespective of the version control system type, project files are stored on a server where you upload your completed work from your local machine. The choice between a centralized version control system like SVN and a distributed version control system like Git impacts the process of committing changes. We will discuss this further in the upcoming sections of the course.
