**Incorporate the following best practices while working with Object Repository:** 

- **Reusability :**You can achieve reusability through different means, such as local elements, snippets, and UI libraries in the Object Repository.

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Use meaningful and descriptive names for objects in the repository. Avoid generic names such as "Button1" and "Link2" as they can become confusing as time progresses.

- **Organize Objects:** Organize objects within a repository by grouping them together by screen, type of object (buttons, input fields, etc.), or any other logical categorization.

- **Scalability:** It is important to design your object repository so that it can grow with your application. As new features are added, ensure the repository can support these changes without becoming inefficient.

- **Version Control:** When publishing a new version of the same UI library, make sure to properly add the new version number to the Publish window.
