## Overview

In scenarios where coordinated interaction among various UI elements is essential, proper synchronization becomes crucial. Without it, the automation process may encounter challenges, including timing conflicts, incorrect data inputs, or even application crashes. 

This is where UI synchronization activities play a crucial role by allowing the robot to pause and wait for specific UI events before proceeding with the next actions. 

Use of UI synchronization activities in an automation ensures that the automation process aligns with the UI's behavior, adapting to dynamic conditions for accurate and reliable results.

***In complex workflows or multi-step processes, synchronization is crucial for various applications, such as:***

- **E-commerce Order Processing**
	Providing accurate item selection, timely payment initiation, and precise order confirmation.
	
- **Banking Transactions**
	Sequencing, fund transfers, balance inquiries, and transaction verifications without errors.

- **Inventory Management**
	Tracking inventory levels, managing stock replenishment, and generating real-time reports.

- **Customer Support Systems**
	Handling incoming requests, prioritizing based on urgency, and routing to the right support channels.

- **Healthcare Systems**
	Securely accessing patient information, scheduling conflict-free appointments, and updating medical records in real-time.

## What are the UI synchronization activities and features in Uipath Studio?

In the modern design experience, UiPath offers a range of UI synchronization activities. These activities include:

- **Check App State Activity**
	This activity allows you to check the state of an application, ensuring that it is in the expected state before proceeding with further actions.

- **Verify Execution Feature**
	With this feature, you can verify that a specific action or activity has been successfully executed before moving on to the next step.

- **Pick Branch Activity**
	The Pick Branch activity provides a flexible way to synchronize and execute different branches of activities based on specific conditions or events.

>[!WARNING]
>**Please note that in the classic design, there were several synchronization activities, but in the modern design, they have been consolidated into the Check App State activity for improved efficiency and simplicity.**
