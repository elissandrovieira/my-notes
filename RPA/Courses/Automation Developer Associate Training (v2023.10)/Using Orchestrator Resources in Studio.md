## üó∫Ô∏èOverview

The deep integration between Orchestrator and Studio, through the interactive sign-in feature, allows Automation Developers to work directly with folder entities like queues, assets, and processes.

## ü§îWhat do we mean when we say ‚Äúresources‚Äù?

Resources can be:
- Assets
- Queues
- Processes 
It are stored in Orchestrator folders, including in personal workspaces. ¬†

The integration between Studio and Orchestrator through the Attended Robot makes working with Orchestrator resources in the development process extremely easy.¬†

A dedicated panel is available in UiPath Studio to drag and drop resources into automation projects.

By selecting the folder button in the lower right corner and switching to our personal workspace, we can view the resources stored in that folder. |
