Workflow Analyzer is a static code analyzer that ensures your project meets high quality and reliability standards. A static code analyzer checks for inconsistencies without actually executing the project, as opposed to dynamic analyzers which step in during execution.

Using the Workflow Analyzer in Studio, you can enforce automation best practices and check for inconsistencies.

This course will help you to learn more about the features and capabilities of Workflow Analyzer, and you will complete an analysis of a Studio project.
