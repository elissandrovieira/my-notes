## Overview

The Verify Execution feature in UiPath is used to validate the correctness of actions performed by activities at runtime. It verifies the desired outcomes by checking and confirming the appearance or disappearance of specified elements after the activity is executed. 

This feature is a property available for the Click, Type Into, and Hover activities. 

By leveraging the Verify Execution feature, you can enhance the accuracy and reliability of automation processes. It helps validate and verify the expected changes and states in UI elements, thus ensuring the correct execution of actions.

# Among its key features are:

1. **Expected Text Verification** 
	 You can specify the expected text to be verified for the Type Into activity. This makes sure that the correct text is entered into the defined field.
    
2. **Retry Mechanism**
	Provides a retry mechanism that allows for automatic retries of the activities if the expected outcome isn't initially achieved. This increases the chances of a successful execution.
    
3. **Element State Verification**
	Enables the verification of element states such as appearance, disappearance, changes in text, or changes in image. This makes sure the desired states are achieved after the activity execution.
