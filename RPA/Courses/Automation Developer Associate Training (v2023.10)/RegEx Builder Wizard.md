# üîç What is Regular Expression?
[[Regular Expression]] (RegEx, or regexp) is a specific search pattern that can be used to easily match, locate and manage text. However, creating RegEx expressions may be challenging. UiPath Studio contains a RegEx builder that simplifies the creation of regular expressions.

Typical uses of RegEx include:

- Input Validation
- String Parsing
- Data Scraping
- String Manipulation

# üîç What are some business scenarios where RegEx is used?
Retrieving pieces of text that follow a certain pattern, for example:

- Extracting phone numbers that start with a certain digit.
- Collecting all the street names from a bulk text, even if they don't follow a specific pattern - some of them contain "Street", others "Rd.", and so on.

It would take much longer to build the same expression using the string method. For example, RegEx has a predefined expression to locate all the URLs in a string.
