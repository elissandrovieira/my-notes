## üó∫Ô∏èLesson overview

Consider a scenario where a team is assigned to develop several processes using UI Automation on the same target application. It is expected that the target application will be upgraded in the future and your team needs a method to quickly update the projects when it happens. In order to resolve this issue, object repositories were introduced in 2020.10. These repositories can quickly fix the issue within a few minutes if the application's upgrade in the future.

## ü§îWhat is Object Repository?

The Object Repository allows for creating and reusing UI taxonomies inside and across automation projects. With Object Repository you can build a UI API for your application and share it with your team within minutes.

## üóùÔ∏èObject Repository's key features

Object repositories in Studio provide the following features:

1. **Centralized Storage**
	Object repositories allow you to store and manage reusable components, activities, and workflows so they are easy to access, update, and maintain.
	
2. **Reusability**
	A repository enables the creation of reusable components, activities, and workflows that can be easily shared and reused across multiple automation projects. This saves time and effort by eliminating the need to recreate the same functionality across multiple projects.
	
3. **Version Control**
	Object repositories support version control, so developers can manage different versions of components or activities. When updating or making changes to existing assets, this feature ensures that older versions can still be referenced if necessary.
	
4. **Collaboration**
	It facilitates collaboration between team members by providing a shared place to store and share automation assets. Multiple developers are able to collaborate, contribute to, and benefit from each other's work.
	
5. **Metadata and Documentation**
	Developers can add metadata and documentation to describe the purpose, usage, and dependencies of each asset, which improves understanding and promotes consistency when using the assets across projects.
	
6. **Search and Discovery**
	Search capabilities provide quick access to specific components or activities based on keywords, descriptions, or tags, reducing duplication.
	
7. **Dependencies Management**
	The object repository enables developers to define relationships and dependencies between different components and activities so that changes in one asset will be reflected in all dependent assets.
	
8. **Security and Access Control:**
	It provides security and access control features, which enable administrators to define user roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized individuals are permitted access, modification, and deletion of repository assets.

## ‚úÖBenefits of using the Object Repository

Let's focus for a moment on understanding the benefits of using the Object Repository.¬†

- UI elements across the project are managed, updated, and modified from a centralized place.

- View a list of all your UI activities inside your process by using the UI Activities tab inside Object Repository panel.

- Quickly capture elements you need in your automation with the Capture Elements wizard.

- Increased selector reliability with the help of the Capture Elements recorder that captures elements, together with their anchors.

- Drag-and-drop elements from the Object Repository panel.

- Objects are reusable in local project or across projects when packaged as libraries.

- Upgrade application and process UI elements in one go with UI libraries.
