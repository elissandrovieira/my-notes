## üó∫Ô∏èOverview

Orchestrator can also be used to store libraries and templates so that they can be used again and again for ¬†reusability among other features that include automation and robot management. Orchestrator is a tool that all developers within a company can use to share development assets and make sure the right versions are being used.

## üìöLibraries
### What is a Library?

Libraries in UiPath encapsulate reusable components, such as login workflows or data processing logic, and are published as **NuGet packages**. Once stored in **Orchestrator**, these libraries can be shared across teams and automation projects to ensure consistency and efficiency.

### Creating Libraries

There are two ways to create a library in UiPath Studio:

- **From scratch** via the "Library" project type.
- **Extracting from an existing process**, turning selected workflows into a reusable library.

Regardless of the method, the goal is to modularize common automation components to avoid redundancy.

### Customizing Library Activities

Each library activity can expose **arguments** as **custom properties**. These can be configured with:

- **Tooltips** for usability
- **Required flags** to enforce input  
    This enhances clarity and control when other developers use the library.

### Publishing to Orchestrator

Before publishing:

- Confirm the **library feed settings** in Orchestrator (Host, Tenant, or both)
- Choose the **deployment type** and security options
- Set a **clear versioning strategy** and release notes

Publishing is done via UiPath Studio, pushing the library package to the Orchestrator feed for reuse.

### Installing & Using Libraries in Projects

Libraries can be added as dependencies in:

- Regular UiPath projects
- **Project templates**, making them available by default in newly created projects

Once installed, the activities become accessible in the Activities panel and behave like any built-in activity.

### Managing Credentials in Reusable Components

When using libraries that require credentials:

- Prefer **Orchestrator Assets**, like credential assets
- Use built-in activities like **Get Credential** to retrieve them securely  
    This approach avoids hardcoding and keeps libraries environment-independent.

### Updating Libraries

Updates to libraries are versioned and managed within Orchestrator:

- New versions can be published from Studio with a changelog
- Existing projects will show an **update notification** if a newer version is available
- Updating is seamless and helps maintain a single source of truth across automations

## üìëTemplates

Templates allow automation teams to:

- Start projects with predefined structure and dependencies
- Include custom libraries by default
- Store templates locally, in Orchestrator, or across networked feeds

Combining templates and libraries supports **modular development, faster onboarding**, and **code reuse** at scale.
