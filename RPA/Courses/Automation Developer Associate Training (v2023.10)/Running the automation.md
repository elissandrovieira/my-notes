>**Note: The demo explains how to connect to Salesforce using the 'Production' environment, but it's better to use a Sandbox or Test environment for actual work to prevent any issues. The creators of this demo are not responsible if anything goes awry in your main system. It's a wise choice to seek assistance from experts if you're unsure.**
