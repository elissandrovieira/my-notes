## Overview

The **Pick** activity is like having someone who can keep an eye on multiple things at once and knows what to do when something happens. It tracks different events or conditions happening simultaneously and determines the appropriate action based on the first event that occurs.

The **Pick Branch** activity is like a group of tasks connected to a specific thing being watched. When that thing happens or changes, the tasks in that group are executed. These activities help in efficiently managing and responding to different situations, making sure the right actions are taken at the right time.
