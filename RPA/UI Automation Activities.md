## üó∫Ô∏èOverview

From the [[User Interface (UI) Automation with Modern Design in Studio]] course, we learned about the essential components of UI automation. These include UI Automation activities, Activity properties, Targeting methods, and Input and Output methods. Together, these components enable developers to effectively interact with the interfaces of various applications.
