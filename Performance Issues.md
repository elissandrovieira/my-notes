## Processor Speed

The basic blocks for the computational miracles we see today are the same as 60 years ago.

- In the past, the biggest challenge in computing was obtaining processing power.
- Today, the biggest challenge is how to squeeze the last drop of performance from the materials at hand.

Nothing is gained by manufacturing powerful processor chips if they do not receive a constant flow of work.
