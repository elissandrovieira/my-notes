- # Tell me a little bit about yourself
	Fist of all, thank you to having me here in these interview.
	I'm Eli. I worked as a Graphic Designer for 10 years and about 5 years in UI and email marketing design. I've worked with some clients worldwide, for example in Spain, and UK. I’ve also worked at some agencies; I would highlight a marketing agency called Digital Uow, where I gained experience working with major Brazilian clients, real estate, food, fashion and ecommerce sectors.
	
	Three years ago, I decided to learn more about web development, because I often struggled with developers regarding the implementation of my designs. Through these studies, I improved my knowledge in creating optimized designs that are both visually appealing and technically achievable.
	
	I am now looking for an opportunity where I can combine my design background with this technical understanding, especially in a team that values collaboration and high-quality email production. I believe my experience could bring real value, while allowing me to continue learning and growing alongside the team.
	
	Thank you once again for the opportunity. I am excited to be here today.
	
- # What do you do when you have a creative block? 
	Most of my creative blocks happen when I don’t have an “aha moment.”  
	To overcome this, I let all ideas flow, even ones I initially think are bad, which often helps me arrive at a good idea.  
	If that doesn’t work, I take a break, have a coffee, and return to work refreshed.
	
- # Where do you get inspiration from? 
- _Scrolling on social media._
	I get inspiration from daily observations and my regular study routine. When starting a project, I often create a mood board to generate insights and ideas.

- # What have you been studying in design?
	Lately, I’ve been focusing on accessibility in email design. I study things like color contrast, readable typography, and proper use of alt text. I’m learning how inclusive design not only improves the user experience but also increases engagement and click-through rates.

- # In your opinion, what makes a great e-mail in terma of design? / What is the more importante thing when it comes to designing an e-mail? 
	In my view, a great email design balances clarity, visual hierarchy, and technical performance. The most important thing is ensuring the message is easy to understand at a first look, especially on mobile.
	
	I focus on mobile-first design, clean layouts, readable typography, and a strong call to action.
	
- # If the e-mail you designed had low click rates, what would you do?
	I understand that low click rates are often related to copy or the offer itself, not only design. From a design perspective, I would refine the visual hierarchy and CTA visibility, then test optimized layouts to drive more clicks.
	
- # Which tools / softwares do you use? 
	I mainly work with Figma, which I have been using for about four years for both email design and UI work. I also use the Adobe Creative Suite, especially Photoshop and Illustrator, and I have been working with Adobe tools since 2012.

- # So, thinking about the emails you've designed, can you give me an example of one you're particularly proud of?
	One campaign I’m particularly proud of was for **Caixa Econômica Federal, a major Brazilian government bank**. They have a very defined brand identity and communication style, which is more popular and conservative. The challenge was to create a series of emails encouraging young couples, with or without children, to buy their first home in Barra da Tijuca, a more upscale neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro.
	
	I used the existing brand elements, while adapting the design to feel more approachable and engaging for a younger audience. I also added visual elements that elevated the perception of value for the offer, making the emails feel aspirational without losing the brand’s identity.
	
	This campaign is a good example of balancing **brand consistency** with **targeted, audience-specific design**, which was both challenging and rewarding.
	
- # What do you do outside of work?
	Outside of work, I enjoy classic mechanical watches as a hobby, and I also follow technology trends, especially smartphones and computers. Most of all, I value spending quality time with my wife and children.
	
- # Do you have any questions?
	Sure, I was wondering...
	_How the company culture like, especially regarding design and innovation?_
	_How the team’s approach to collaboration between designers and copywriters or email specialists?_

	I got it! Thank you for explain to me.

- # How do you ensure that your designs remain consistent with the brand?
	To maintain strong brand consistency in email design, I always start by reviewing the brand guidelines and fully understanding the brand’s voice and visual identity. I apply the correct typography, color palette, imagery style, spacing rules, and graphic elements in every layout.
	
	I also create or follow a design system for emails, with reusable components that ensure visual coherence across campaigns. Before delivering the final work, I review the design against the guidelines and verify alignment with the brand’s tone and messaging direction provided by the copy team.
	
	This helps every email feel like a natural part of the brand, not just a single isolated piece.

### Como responder se te perguntarem

> _I have experience working with email design best practices compatible with Klaviyo. I know how to structure responsive layouts using Klaviyo’s editor, use personalization elements like profile fields, and follow visual strategies that improve click-through performance. I also understand the basics of flows, campaigns, and A/B testing to support continuous optimization. If needed, I can deepen my knowledge very quickly._

The video, 'How To Design High-Converting Emails with Figma for Klaviyo In 2024,' was highly compelling because it effectively demonstrates that **email design is a critical business priority**, not merely an aesthetic concern. The content clearly outlines how well-designed emails are essential for building trust, reinforcing brand identity, and actively **driving results and revenue**. I found the strategic focus on maximizing conversions—by ensuring strong visual hierarchy, clear Calls to Action (CTAs), and mobile optimization—particularly valuable. By detailing the necessity of balancing different email styles (Graphic, Plain Text, and Branded Text) to suit diverse audience preferences, the guide illustrates a robust methodology where design is directly correlated with higher engagement and a maximized Return on Investment (ROI)."

I like Das Haus Digital because they truly value design while keeping a strong focus on business goals. And I appreciate what you share in website... their collaborative, multidisciplinary approach.
